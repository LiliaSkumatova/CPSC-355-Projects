an A64 assembly language program that finds the minimum of  y = y=5x^4-448x^2-63x+10 in the  range -10 <= x <= 10, 
by stepping through the range one by one in a loop and testing. Uses only long integers for x, and does not factor the expression. 
Uses the printf() function to display to the screen the values of x, y and the current minimum on each iteration of the loop.
