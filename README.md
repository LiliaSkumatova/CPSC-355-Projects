Assignment 1: 

an A64 assembly language program that finds the minimum of  y = y=5x^4-448x^2-63x+10 in the  range -10 <= x <= 10,  by stepping through the range one by one in a loop and testing. Uses only long integers for x, and does not factor the expression. Uses the printf() function to display to the screen the values of x, y and the current minimum on each iteration of the loop.

Assignment 2:

Given C code for an integer multiplication program, implement it into ARMv8. Demonstrates bitwise logical and shift operations, branching, condition code tests, hexadecimal, and binary.

Assignment 4:

Implement C code with numerous subroutines/structures into ARMv8. Demonstrates the usage of structs, nested structs, and subroutines, as well as the return of structs by value from a function and the use of pointers as parameters to subroutines.

Assignment 5:

Translate C code that creates a stack data structure with an array to ARMv8. External variables, independent compilation, collating asm functions from main(), calling library functions from routines, and external arrays of pointers are all demonstrated.

Assignment 6:

Write a program to compute the function arctan9x) using series expansions. Using double precision floating-point numbers, read input, and product output. Additionally uses input/ouput with a text file.
